This library is for learning purposes. It's based on the [repository](https://github.com/alexrichterxyz/research_limit_order_book/tree/main).

# TODO

* Introduce full Limit Order Book with a minimal set of files.
* Create benchmarks for performance when doing matching against [NASDAQ-ITCH open datasets](https://emi.nasdaq.com/ITCH/Nasdaq%20ITCH/).
* Use [CppTrader](https://github.com/chronoxor/CppTrader/tree/master) for benchmarking.
* Unit Tests
* Logger timing and comparisons.
* Using much it increases using [atomic_queue](https://github.com/max0x7ba/atomic_queue)?
* Thread safety? Compare to [orderbook](https://github.com/bigfatwhale/orderbook)
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) for Python API 
* Concurrency?
